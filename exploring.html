        <p>Blarney Castle and Garden is located in Blarney, and is one of the most famous and beautiful places in
            Ireland.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Blarney Castle was built in the 1500s and was taken by Queen Elizabeth I, it is a huge castle with huge, tall
            walls and dungeons.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Don't forget the amazing garden surrounding the castle with 60 acres of surprises, delights and mysteries
            waiting to be discovered.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The main intrigue is the Blarney Stone!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The Blarney Stone is suppose to have mystical powers of Gab (great eloquence or skill at flattery).

        <p>BallyCotton Cliff Walk is a personal favourite of mine, found in Ballycotton.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This walk is 7.4 kilometers and is worth the pain and agony of walking that long.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>The sites you walk by and the sea could not look any better while you try catch your breathe.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>You walk through many different places such as Ballytrasna, Ballyandreen and Cloyne.

            Coqbull is a chicken and Burger restaurant found in 5th French Chruch, Cork City.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Don't let that keep you away from their Delicious donuts with a side of almost any chocolate you could
            imagine.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            For me, this is a need to go place, the food is amazing and staff are so welcoming.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Its as close to the city center without all the noise that comes with that.

            Lab 82 is a beautiful diner on 82 Lower Glanmire Rd, Victorian Quarter where you can go and have Pancakes,
            Burgers, Brownies, and Brunch.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The desserts and breakfast here are to die for! Staff are unbelievably kidn and helpful. No need to reserve
            a seat as its all walk-ins.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The only problem I can find with this place is the opening hours.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I can honestly say I have never been disappointed while being served here.

            Tequila Jacks is located in City Quarter, Lapp's Quay and is one of the most unique and original restaurants
            you can find.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            It serves excellent Mexican Food and in my opinion is a must see for people who are here to try something
            new and creative.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            What makes this place so unique is the domes outside you can dine in right outside the restaurant, towards
            the river side.

        <p>Ballyhass Adventure Group has two locations, one in Mallow and the other in Coachford. Both locations are
            huge leisure centers made for big family/ student events.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This is one for people who love to do something a bit adventurous and new, this place is water themed for
            those who like to get out of their comfort zone.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>It has everything you want including a Sauna, wakeboarding, axe throwing, aquaparks and much more.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>I believe if you ever decide to leave your house and can only go one place, this is the place to be.

        <p>Trabolgan is found at Rathmore Lane and is a massive Leisure Center.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Trabolgan has Mini-golf, swimming pools/ classes, tennis courts, zip lining and kart racing!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Also you can stay in the village for the weekend with friends and family.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Only downside is it hasnt been seen huge investment of recent and feels a tad out of date compared to some
            places, this doesnt take away from an amazing time but could add to it.

        <p>You can find Perks Family Entertainment & Indoor Funfair in Seafield, Youghal and is another Leisure center
            although this is the indoor for all those who hate the outside world.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Perks is known for hosting Birthday Parties and scholl tours across Cork for as long as I can remember.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Perks has entertainment for all ages, for adults you have the Casino section, teenagers you have bowling and
            laser tag. Children have everything you can imagine from a Jungle gym to bumper cars!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Perks also has food to offer for parties of all sizes.
